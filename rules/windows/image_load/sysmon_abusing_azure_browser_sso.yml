  title: Abusing Azure Browser SSO
sigma_fields: true
description: Detects abusing Azure Browser SSO by requesting OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens
  for an Azure-AD-authenticated Windows user (i.e. the machine is joined to Azure
  AD and a user logs in with their Azure AD account) wanting to perform SSO authentication
  in the browser. An attacker can use this to authenticate to Azure AD in a browser
  as that user.
