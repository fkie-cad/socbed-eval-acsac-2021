  title: Load of dbghelp/dbgcore DLL from Suspicious Process
sigma_fields: true
description: Detects the load of dbghelp/dbgcore DLL (used to make memory dumps) by
  suspicious processes. Tools like ProcessHacker and some attacker tradecract use
  MiniDumpWriteDump API found in dbghelp.dll or dbgcore.dll. As an example, SilentTrynity
  C2 Framework has a module that leverages this API to dump the contents of Lsass.exe
  and transfer it over the network back to the attacker's machine.
